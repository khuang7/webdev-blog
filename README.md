# A blog experiment

This is a website blog I built, by experiment putting blog posts on firebase. It is quite experimental and uses old school Javascript (before i learnt about the wonders of Typescript)

## What this website does
Allows user to add blog posts and pages (storing all this data in noSQL firebase). The ability to add topics as well. Some information of this blog can be found here https://old.kevh.dev
